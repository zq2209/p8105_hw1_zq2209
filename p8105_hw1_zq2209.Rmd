Problem 1
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

```{r}
summary(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
```

The dataset contains 8 variables, which are species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, and year. Species, island and sex are qualitative variables. Others are quantitative variables. 

The size of the dataset is 344 rows by 8 columns, 344 X 8.

The mean for flipper length is 200.9mm. 

```{r}
scatterplot_penguins = ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, col = species)) + geom_point()
ggsave("scatterplot_penguins.pdf", plot = scatterplot_penguins)
```
